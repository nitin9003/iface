		<p class="lead">A big challenge for hospitals today is the management of mobile medical equipment. A mid-size hospital already has thousands of mobile devices.</p>
		<p>Medical devices that are used for patient care in hospitals are subject to systematic preventive maintenance procedures enforced by the Joint Commission in the U.S., recommended by the WHO, and required by authorities in several other countries. The goal for the maintenance procedures is to reduce the risk of equipment malfunction that can lead to costly and life-threatening mistakes in patient care.</p>
		<p>To cope with the maintenance requirement and to assure optimum availability, the biomedical department needs to have a system for finding its medical equipment for routine cleaning and re-calibration. </p>
		<p class="lead">Wi-Fi healthcare asset tracking is the practical solution</p>
		<p>A simple remedy to the problem is to have a system that knows the whereabouts of all equipment at all times and anywhere on the campus. The IFace RTLS (Real Time Location System) offers a simple to use, healthcare asset tracking solution for locating equipment using a Web browser, even when equipment is locked behind closed doors.</p> 
		<p>Service requests, system alerts and various system triggers can all be sent to the IFace Wi-Fi Staff Badges. This way the engineering staff can be made fully aware of all system alerts and requests while they are working around the hospital.</p>
		<p>IFace’s RTLS healthcare asset management system has been designed from the ground up to cater to the needs of hospitals. By leveraging an existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, the complete system can be up and running in a few weeks with no disruption to patient care or the facilities themselves. IFace’s proven technology are the basis for consistently winning RTLS bake-offs around the world.</p>
